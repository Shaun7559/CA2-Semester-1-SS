      " Following the publication of a letter from scientists questioning data on the health impacts of red meat, IFA President Tim Cullinan has written to the Editor in Chief of The Lancet; the Minister for Agriculture Charlie McConalogue; the EU Commission; the United Nations; and the WHO asking that the questions raised by the scientists be addressed. \n",
      "“These key policy-making agencies, which are responsible for public health guidelines, must address the scientific questions raised about a study which attempted to demonise red meat,” he said. \n",
      "“The data in question, from ‘Global Burden of Disease’ of 2019, has since been cited in 635 documents, 351 scientific papers and nine policy documents. The questions raised by the scientists in The Lancet must be addressed urgently by the original authors and policy makers,” he said.\n",
      "“The scientists have been fighting a long battle to have their concerns published by The Lancet. There must now be a response from the Global Burden of Disease to address the problem. If this is not forthcoming, then policy-making agencies must disregard the study and revisit any policies which were influenced by it,” he said. \n",
      "So far, it appears the original authors, the ‘Global Burden of Disease’ based in the US, have declined to properly address the scientific questions raised by the scientists, which include Prof. Alice Stanton and Prof. Patrick Wall from Ireland.\n"

      "UCD AG Soc grand raffle 2022. Top prize is a Fordson Dexta. All proceeds go to Hooves4Hospice and Irish Community Air Ambulance.\n",
      "UCD’s Agricultural Science Society (Ag Soc) raffle is coming to an end, with the raffle set to close on Friday 13 May at Balmoral Show. The winners will be announced on Saturday 14 May.\n",
      "This year’s raffle has been supported by a wide variety of companies and organisations across the country, with a number of exceptional prizes up for grabs and over €20,000 worth of prizes to be won.\n",
      "There are a large number of prizes available, with first prize being ‘Dixie’ a fully restored Fordson Dexta vintage tractor, sponsored by FBD Insurance.\n",
      "Also included in the list of prizes is two tonnes of Terra CAN, pedigree Limousin and Fleckvieh heifers, a Grasshopper and much more.\n",
      "There is also a selection of non-agricultural prizes which include a Coppers Gold card, a Tipperary dry-aged Angus meat hamper worth €500 and a spa weekend getaway for two in Mount Wolseley Hotel.\n",
      "Charities\n",
      "The two worthy charities chosen by the society this year are Hooves 4 Hospice and the Irish Community Air Ambulance.\n",
      "Hooves 2 Hospice is a charity that has joined forces with the farming community and supportive organisations to raise a sizeable sum of money towards the costs of building the much-needed Midland Regional Hospice. They aim to recruit a large number of farmers who are willing to rear an animal, and donate the animal or the funds from the animal to the charity.\n",
      "The second charity selected is the Irish Community Air Ambulance, Ireland’s only dedicated, and charity funded air ambulance. The Irish Community Air Ambulance is an asset of the National Ambulance Service and responds to the most serious trauma and medical emergencies in rural Ireland. In their first 12 months of service, nearly 500 missions were carried out, with each mission costing €3,000.\n",
      "The UCD AgSoc has a long history of raising money for charities both on and off campus with their events throughout the year, such as an ag-week, an on campus teashop and much more.\n",

      "Making the final call on maiden heifers for breeding\n",
      "Replacement heifers should have a minimum target liveweight to meet before the breeding season starts. This improves conception rates and reduces issues at calving time.\n",

      "BEEF > MANAGEMENT\n",
      "10 May 2022\n",
      "Replacement heifers should meet a minimum target weight before breeding starts.\n",
      "On suckler farms where cows calve during March and April, breeding usually gets under way towards the end of May.\n",
      "Therefore now is the time to make a final call on maiden heifers that will be mated this year. Breeding weight is crucial to get heifers cycling and holding to service.\n",
      "It is also a major factor in getting heifers fully developed, so they can cope with the demands of pregnancy, calving, producing milk and going back in-calf again next year.\n",
      "The heavier the better\n",
      "Heifers should weigh at least 60% of the average mature cow weight in the herd once breeding starts. But the heavier heifers are, the better.\n",
      "If mature cows are typically 750kg, then heifers should weigh at least 450kg now. Any lighter and the chances of calving difficulty and not going back in-calf increase.\n",
      "So over the next week, maiden heifers should be weighed to get an accurate handle on liveweight. Heifers below the target breeding weight should be removed from the group.\n",
      "However, heifers that exhibit more extreme muscling in the hindquarters should be avoided, regardless if they meet target breeding weights.\n",
      "These animals are also more likely to encounter greater problems at calving time next year, even when bred to easy calving sires.\n",

      "UCD AG Soc grand raffle 2022. Top prize is a Fordson Dexta. All proceeds go to Hooves4Hospice and Irish Community Air Ambulance.\n",
      "UCD’s Agricultural Science Society (Ag Soc) raffle is coming to an end, with the raffle set to close on Friday 13 May at Balmoral Show. The winners will be announced on Saturday 14 May.\n",
      "This year’s raffle has been supported by a wide variety of companies and organisations across the country, with a number of exceptional prizes up for grabs and over €20,000 worth of prizes to be won.\n",
      "There are a large number of prizes available, with first prize being ‘Dixie’ a fully restored Fordson Dexta vintage tractor, sponsored by FBD Insurance.\n",
      "Also included in the list of prizes is two tonnes of Terra CAN, pedigree Limousin and Fleckvieh heifers, a Grasshopper and much more.\n",
      "There is also a selection of non-agricultural prizes which include a Coppers Gold card, a Tipperary dry-aged Angus meat hamper worth €500 and a spa weekend getaway for two in Mount Wolseley Hotel.\n",
      "Charities\n",
      "The two worthy charities chosen by the society this year are Hooves 4 Hospice and the Irish Community Air Ambulance.\n",
      "Hooves 2 Hospice is a charity that has joined forces with the farming community and supportive organisations to raise a sizeable sum of money towards the costs of building the much-needed Midland Regional Hospice. They aim to recruit a large number of farmers who are willing to rear an animal, and donate the animal or the funds from the animal to the charity.\n",
      "The second charity selected is the Irish Community Air Ambulance, Ireland’s only dedicated, and charity funded air ambulance. The Irish Community Air Ambulance is an asset of the National Ambulance Service and responds to the most serious trauma and medical emergencies in rural Ireland. In their first 12 months of service, nearly 500 missions were carried out, with each mission costing €3,000.\n",
      "The UCD AgSoc has a long history of raising money for charities both on and off campus with their events throughout the year, such as an ag-week, an on campus teashop and much more.\n",
      "You can buy a ticket and donate through here.\n",
